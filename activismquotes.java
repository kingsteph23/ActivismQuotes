“The world is not changing if you don’t shoulder the burden of responsibility.”
“Freedom is a pretty strange thing. Once you’ve experienced it, 
it remains in your heart, and no one can take it away. Then, as an individual, 
you can be more powerful than a whole country.”
„A land that rejects the truth, barricades itself against change 
and lacks the spirit of freedom is hopeless.“ Source: https://quotepark.com/authors/ai-weiwei/quotes-about-freedom/ Source: https://quotepark.com/authors/ai-weiwei/quotes-about-freedom/ Source: https://quotepark.com/authors/ai-weiwei/quotes-about-freedom/ Source: https://quotepark.com/authors/ai-weiwei/quotes-about-freedom/ Source: https://quotepark.com/authors/ai-weiwei/quotes-about-freedom/

    mlk- “There comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, 
    nor politic, nor popular, but he must take it because conscience tells him it is right.”

    “Science investigates; religion interprets. Science gives man knowledge, 
    which is power; religion gives man wisdom, 
    which is control. Science deals mainly with facts; religion deals mainly with values. 
    The two are not rivals.”


    “Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.”


    “Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.”

    Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere
     "We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope."


    //james baldwin
    “You think your pain and your 
    heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read.”
       
    “People can cry much easier than they can change.”

"The paradox of education is precisely this — 
that as one begins to become conscious one begins to examine the society 
in which he is being educated."

“It is certain, in any case, that ignorance, allied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have.”
    
“I imagine one of the reasons people 
cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, 
once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.”

    
    //obama“Change will not come if we wait for some other person 
    or some other time. We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. 
    We are the change that we seek.”

    “When we don’t pay close attention to the decisions made by our leaders, 
    when we fail to educate ourselves about the major issues of the day, 
    when we choose not to make our voices and opinions heard, 
    that’s when democracy breaks down. That’s when power is abused. 
    That’s when the most extreme voices in our society fill the void that we leave. 
    That’s when powerful interests and their lobbyists are most able to buy access and influence in the corridors of power
     – because none of us are there to speak up and stop them.” – Barack Obama

     "the arc if the universe may bend toward justice, but it doesn't bend on its own"

     "dont boo vote"

    “Progress will come in fits and starts. 
    It’s not always a straight line. It’s not always smooth path.”
    “Change is never easy, but always possible.”
    //malcom x
    “A man who stands for nothing will fall for anything.”
    “You don’t have to be a man to fight for freedom.
     All you have to do is to be an intelligent human being.” 
     Change Is Only a Good Thing If You Change in a Good Way.


     Education is an important element in the struggle for human rights. 
     It is the means to help our children and thereby increase self-respect. 

     It is the process of mis-education that inhibits the full potential of a nation.

     “Without education, you’re not going anywhere in this world.”
    //angela davis
    “We have to talk about liberating minds as well as liberating society.”

    “It’s important to remain optimistic regardless of the situation you are facing.”

     “You have to believe that you can change society. 
     You have to do it all of the time and not just once in a while.”

     “Freeing our minds is just as important as freeing ourselves from our situations.”

    “In a prejudiced world, it’s better to be anti-racist than non racist.”


    //cesar chavez
    “Preservation of one’s own culture does not require contempt or disrespect for other cultures.”

    "Once social change begins, it cannot be reversed. 
    You cannot un-educate the person who has learned to read. 
    You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride. 
    You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore."


    "Society is made up of groups, and as long as the smaller groups do not have 
    the same rights and the same protection as others...
    it is not going to work. Somehow the guys in power have to be reached by 
    counterpower, or through a  change in the hearts and minds, or change will not come."

“True wealth is not measured in money or status or power. 
It is measured in the legacy we leave behind for those we love and those we inspire.” Cesar Chavez

“Once social change begins, it cannot be reversed. We have seen the future, and the future is ours.” Cesar Chavez

We cannot seek achievement for ourselves and forget about progress and prosperity for our community.
 Our ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of others, 
 for their sakes and for our own.” Cesar Chavez
